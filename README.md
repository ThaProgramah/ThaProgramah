## Hi there

Even as a child, I wanted to know how the world works. I had a huge encyclopedia and from then on I was able to satisfy my thirst for knowledge without any hindrance. Since that day, I have learned something new every day. This thirst for knowledge has never disappeared. When the Internet came along and I learned to program, a new universe of possibilities opened up. If you want to know what happened when I learned how to use artificial intelligence for yourself, then take a closer look at my repo.
